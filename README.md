# Telomatic
*Telomatic* is an exploration of post-digital intersubjectivity, through sculptural and computational electronic art.<br>
Drawing inspiration from telematic art, technology ethics and cypherpunk ideas, this project seeks to comment on and propose playfully engaging alternatives to the dematerialization of contemporary virtualized landscapes as well as address concerns of cybersecurity in our increasingly connected age.<br>
In theory, it is an interactive experience reverse-engineering embodied possibilities of telematic experience. In practice, it presents as a silicone-cast telehaptic anal plug actuated by online interaction.<br>
The viewer initially engages with the piece through an apparently innocuous web application proposing an augmented reality drawing activity using machine-learning trained real-time hand pose detection (The Apparatus). The data generated by this activity also serves, via a wireless connection, to vibrate the plug (The Exparatus). The Apparatus and Exparatus are spatially segregated so that the viewer only later understands the relationship between the initial ludic action and its telematic consequences.
