# Telomatic - Web
The viewer initially engages with the piece through a web application proposing an augmented reality drawing activity using machine-learning trained models allowing real-time hand pose detection. Using their right index finger, they trace a line of which the weight and colour can be modulated with the left index finger. This digital finger-painting canvas is superposed on the webcam video feed.<br>
The viewer can then take a screenshot of their drawing, which is uploaded to a gallery and echoed back to the viewer as a scannable QR code, as well as access the gallery of previous viewers' drawings, a collage that can be used as a meta-canvas for a random *cadavre exquis* or an intentional *générateur poïétique*.<br><br>
Technically, the application rests on a structure of HTML & CSS, is scripted in Javascript & PHP, and implements [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for DOM manipulations, [jQueryUI](https://jqueryui.com/) for GUI element generation, [MediaPipe Hands](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html) for hand position detection and [QRCode.js](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs) for QR code generation and formatting.<br>
A few elements (e.g. PHP scripting and server implementation) were achieved with extensive help from Sabine Rosenberg.
